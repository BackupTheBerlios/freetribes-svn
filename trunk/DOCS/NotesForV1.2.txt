livestock table needs totally re-done

should be : tribeid  int(6) unsigned  autoincrement
Cattle   int(8) unsigned
Horses      int(8) unsigned
Elephants   int(8) unsigned
Goats       int(8) unsigned
Sheep       int(8) unsigned
Pigs        int(8) unsigned
Dogs        int(8) unsigned

//this would considerably help things in the code, requirements : re-do tribes table
have a players table with player info, options, (clan name, etc) then have a tribes table
for individual tribes and subtribes, allow players to name tribes and associate tribe id with player id
simple

because this will completely change the structure of teh databases , let's do the rest
and make this version 1.2

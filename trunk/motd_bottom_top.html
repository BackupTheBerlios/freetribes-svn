<STRONG>Welcome to CrazyBri TribeStrive</STRONG>

<P align=center>This is a production game for players. Resets will occur approximately every 3 - 6 months as we 
determine how the game will play out.. when it gets "full" of top players, we'll probably reset again.<br>
Feel free to create a clan and start playing. Enjoy the game, and Good luck!

<strong><big>Attention!:<br></big></strong>
I am currently planning a *second* game of tribestrive called "Fast Tribes" - turns will run 4 times as fast - 30 day 
months and 4 game months per day. <br> Daily ("monthly") scheduler runs will occur at 0000, 0600, 1200, and 1800 hours 
daily... <br>
The purpose is to advance and speed up bugfixes and game improvements using "real world" testing of the game aat an 
advanced pace.. Sounds like fun?  When it is set up, it will be at <br>

Plans are to have it running by midnight EDT 4/27/2005<br><br>
